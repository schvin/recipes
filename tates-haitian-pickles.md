From James Tate

2 cups shredded cabbage
1 large carrot julienned
1 cup bell pepper (green, orange, red) julienned
1/2 cup English cucumber de-seeded and julienned
1 onion julienned
2 scallions
3 scotch bonnet peppers (you can add more, take out the ribs and seeds to adjust the heat also. Make sure you use gloves)
4-6 cloves garlic minced
1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
1 teaspoon of cracked black pepper
2 tablespoons of sugar (dissolve in 2 tablespoons of warm water)
12-14 peppercorns
3-4 cloves
2 tablespoons of fresh thyme
3-4 Allspice pimento berries
2 cups vinegar 
1/2 lime juice (optional)

Of course you don't have to make this much. From what I've read it will keep in the fridge for months make sure you put it in a nice sealed jar.
